        <p className='text-xl mt-20'>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Oktay and I'm from Berlin, Germany. As a Full-Stack software developer, I specialize in creating visually appealing websites, apps and mobile games. My passion for graphic design isn't just a hobby, it's a key ingredient in every project I work on.

        <p className='text-xl'>
        Growing up bilingual, I developed a love for languages and I currently speak four of them fluently. I believe that this skill has given me a unique perspective and allows me to communicate effectively with clients from all over the world. One of my strengths is adding a personal touch to my projects by adding the client's identity and message into the design, creating meaningful and beautiful end products that are both eye-catching and user-friendly.
